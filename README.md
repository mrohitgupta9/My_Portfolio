Portfolio Website â€“ This is a personal portfolio website that I built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience. The website is fully responsive (works smoothly on both mobile and desktop) and is designed using React components for a modular structure. The UI is clean and interactive with smooth animations and also includes a dark/light mode toggle for a better user experience.
